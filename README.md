This Java program implements a simple Student Management System using object-oriented programming principles.
It defines a Student class with private attributes such as PRN (Personal Registration Number), name, date of birth (DOB), and marks.
The program utilizes an ArrayList to store instances of the Student class, allowing dynamic management of student records. 
Through a menu-driven interface, users can perform various operations including adding new students, displaying all students, searching for students by PRN or name, 
updating student information, and deleting students from the system.
Each operation is encapsulated within its respective method, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. This program demonstrates the concepts of classes,
arrays of objects (ArrayList in this case), instance members, constructors, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities in Java.
